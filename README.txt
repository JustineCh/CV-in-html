It's a CV created using HTML5, CSS3 and a little of JS for loading personal data.

To fill personal data you have to create your own personal-data.json file.

For my own personal data protection the personal-data.json file is unavailable here.

The form of personal-data.json should look as follows:

{
   "address":"...",
   "address_href":"http://maps.google.com/?q=...",
   "phone":"...",
   "phone_href":"tel:...",
   "email":"...",
   "email_href":"mailto:..."
}
